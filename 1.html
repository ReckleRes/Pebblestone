  <h2>Coca-Cola</h2>
<p><strong><a href="https://www.coca-colajourney.co.kr/" target="_blank" title="cocacola official website">
Coca-Cola</a></strong>, or Coke, is a carbonated soft drink manufactured by The Coca-Cola Company.<br>
Originally marketed as a temperance drink and intended as a patent medicine,<br>
 it was invented in the late 19th century by John Stith Pemberton and was bought out by businessman Asa Griggs Candler,<br>
  whose marketing tactics led Coca-Cola to its dominance of the world soft-drink market throughout the 20th century.<br>
  The drink's name refers to two of its original ingredients: coca leaves, and kola nuts (a source of caffeine).<br>
  The current formula of Coca-Cola remains a trade secret; however, a variety of reported recipes and experimental recreations have been published.<br>
